## mustache.js  Logic-less {{mustache}} templates 

mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. And,
since mustache supports various languages, we don’t need a separate templating system on the server side.

Where to use mustache.js  ?
You can use mustache.js to render mustache templates anywhere you can use JavaScript. 
This includes web browsers, server-side environments such as Node.js, and CouchDB views.

### flex layout

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
