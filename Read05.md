### What is  Heroku
Heroku is a cloud platform as a service. That means you do not have to worry about infrastructure; you just focus on your application.

 ### features of Heroku:

• Instant Deployment with Git push - build of your application is performed by Heroku using your build scripts

• Plenty of Add-on resources (applications, databases etc.)

• Processes scaling - independent scaling for each component of your app without affecting functionality and performance

• Isolation - each process (aka dyno) is completely isolated from each other

• Full Logging and Visibility - easy access to all logging output from every component of your app and each process (dyno)
