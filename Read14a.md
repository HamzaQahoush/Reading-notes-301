### Database normalization

is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns

###  Reasons for Normalization
There are three main reasons to normalize a database:

• The first is to minimize duplicate data,\
• the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues,\
•  the third is to simplify queries. 

 *Duplicated information presents two problems:*

-It increases storage and decreases performance.\
-It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.

### Definition of Normalization:\
-First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table and each column contains atomic values, and there are not repeating groups of columns.\
-Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.\
-Third Normal Form – The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
