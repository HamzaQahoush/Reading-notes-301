### Functional programming

 It is languages are specially designed to handle symbolic computation and list processing applications. Functional programming is based on mathematical functions.

### Functional programming languages are categorized into two groups : 

Pure Functional Languages − These types of functional languages support only the functional paradigms. For example − Haskell.

Impure Functional Languages − These types of functional languages support the functional paradigms and imperative style programming. For example − LISP.

### Functional Programming – Advantages

• Bugs-Free Code 

• Efficient Parallel Programming − Functional programming languages have NO Mutable state, so there are no state-change issues. 

•Efficiency − Functional programs consist of independent units that can run concurrently. As a result, such programs are more efficient.

• Supports Nested Functions − Functional programming supports Nested Functions.

• Lazy Evaluation − Functional programming supports Lazy Functional Constructs like Lazy Lists, Lazy Maps, etc.



### Refactoring
Refactoring is a process to change the code to make it more 'good' without changing the functionality. 

### Why refactoring?

The reason why we use refactoring is like this :

• Readability - Because a 'good' program is a program that is easy to read. Not only for the person who made it but also for the other people who are in a team.

• DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) - No need to rewrite the code of a program.

• Testability - Code writing that will make it easier when testing.

• Performance - Code writing that upgradable performances.

• Maintainability - Easily managed and developed.
