## mustache.js  Logic-less {{mustache}} templates 

mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. And,
since mustache supports various languages, we donâ€™t need a separate templating system on the server side.

Where to use mustache.js  ?
You can use mustache.js to render mustache templates anywhere you can use JavaScript. 
This includes web browsers, server-side environments such as Node.js, and CouchDB views.
